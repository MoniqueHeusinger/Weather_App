# The Weather App ☀️🌧️

The Weather App displays the current weather for a city chosen by the user.

The landing page shows the fictional weather data of the heavenly city of Pleasantville.

To view the weather in another city, you can use the top search bar (enter the city or country or zip code for a result).

The App uses a weather API (Open Weather API - https://openweathermap.org/).
